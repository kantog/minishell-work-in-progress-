This is the ninth project I did for Campus 19 (part of the international **42 Network**). I made my own version of the Bash shell, complete with pipes, redirects, environment variables, built-in commands and more. 

By completely rebduilding our working environment from scratch, we gain a deep and practical knowledge of processes, pipes, file descriptors and many more quintessential concepts innate to the Unix architecture. We also get experience in building and implementing a parsing grammar for user input, by using an abstract syntax tree.

Allowed functions: readline, rl_clear_history, rl_on_new_line, rl_replace_line, rl_redisplay, add_history, printf, malloc, free, write, access, open, read, nclose, fork, wait, waitpid, wait3, wait4, signal, sigaction, sigemptyset, sigaddset, kill, exit, getcwd, chdir, stat, lstat, fstat, unlink, execve, dup, dup2, pipe, opendir, readdir, closedir, strerror, perror, isatty, ttyname, ttyslot, ioctl, getenv, tcsetattr, tcgetattr, tgetent, tgetflag, tgetnum, tgetstr, tgoto, tputs

**Score: 100/100**
